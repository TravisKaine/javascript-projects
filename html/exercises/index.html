    <h1>Why I Love Web Development</h1>
    <ol>1. it allows you to turn the ideas most people can only imagine into reality.</ol>
    <ol>2. every piece of work is really just a puzzle in disguise.</ol>
    <ol>3. it allows you to speak to a machine and interact with tech in a way most people can't</ol>

      As a new web developer eager to showcase my coding abilities, I'm excited about the prospect of
       creating a website that not only demonstrates my technical skills but also engages visitors in
       a fun and interactive way. Incorporating games into the website is an idea that particularly
       resonates with me, as it provides an opportunity to not only entertain users but also to
       demonstrate my proficiency in various programming languages and technologies. Whether it's
       implementing classic games like Pac Man or developing more complex interactive experiences,
       I see it as a chance to flex my creative muscles and leave a lasting impression on visitors.</p>
